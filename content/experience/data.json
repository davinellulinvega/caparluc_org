The aim of the workshop was to introduce children between the age of five and twelve to the concepts of AI. For the group activity I was in charge of, I had to build a deep learning system capable of categorizing audio clips, where each clip consisted in a person mimicking the sound of an object or animal. For example, a child would imitate the sound of a car or a lion, and the system would output an image corresponding to a car or a lion, respectively. The system was trained on [Google's Audioset](https://research.google.com/audioset/). The system achieved an 80% accuracy on a test set made of recordings of children mimicking the sound of various objects."
