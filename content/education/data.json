The goal of the project was to show that emotions inform the brain as to the nature of a given situation and guide the decision-making process, to increase the survival potential of virtual agents. In particular, I showed that by using a computational model of the circuits found at the base of the forebrain a group of virtual agents was able to outperform other emotional agents in terms of survival capabilities."
